######<b> LegoBroadcast </b>
A simple and extremely configurable broadcasting plugin! 
Actually, nothing else to say. Read the documentation tab for more info about the config!
Hope you enjoy my plugin.

### Documentation
The setting.yml file (1.0.0):
```yaml
---
message-select-mode: in-order
message-send-method: chat
messages:
- message1
- message2
- message3
- message4
- message5
- message6
seconds: "30"
prefix: '[LegoBroadcast]'
...
```
The part message-select-mode only has 2 options, random or in-order.
The part message-send-method has 3 options, which are chat, popup and tip.
For the others, please use you common sense :)
